# Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Interaction scripts

This project contains several scripts for interacting with Bitcoin hardware wallets.

## Using

You will need a version of Python (2 or 3, does not matter). The main script is `hwi.py`.

## Developing

The scripts are designed to be used in both Python 2 and 3 applications, so all function calls must be valid in Python 2 and 3.
